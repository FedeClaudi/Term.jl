Generally though, when multiple styles are \n    applied to the same string, it's better to be explicit in exactly where each style starts and ends.\n\n\n### Under the hood.\n\nIf you're reading here you're curious about what exactly is happening under the hood. So let's get started.\n`Term.jl`, like `rich` in python, defines a simple markup language to specify the style of bits of strins.\nAs we saw, the syntax is very simple with an opening and closing tag specifying the style and marking the start and end of the styled text. \n\nSo the first thing that needs to happen is the **detection** of these markup tags. This is surprisingly hard because there's so many possible combinations. You can have markup tags whose style information varies considerably, you can have nested tags, you can have tags spread across lines and you can have nested tags spread across lines:\n","category":"page"},{"location":"styled_text/","page":"styled text","title":"styled text","text":"@example tprint(     \"\"\" And [blue] somehow it [bold red] all [/bold red] has to [green underline] always work [/green underline] correctly [/blue] somehow.     \"\"\" )","category":"page"},{"location":"styled_text/","page":"styled text","title":"styled text","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"styled_text/","page":"styled text","title":"styled text","text":"@meta CurrentModule = Term.markup","category":"page"},{"location":"styled_text/","page":"styled text","title":"styled text","text":"\nAll of this is taken care of by:","category":"page"},{"location":"styled_text/","page":"styled text","title":"styled text","text":"@docs extract_markup ```","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = Term","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Term.jl is a Julia library for producing, styled and beautiful terminal output, like this:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"import Term\nprint(Term.make_logo())","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Term.jl uses a simple markup syntax to add style information to standard Julia strings.
