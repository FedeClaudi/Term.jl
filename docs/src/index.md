```@meta
CurrentModule = Term
```

`Term.jl` is a Julia library for producing, styled and beautiful terminal output, like this:

```@example
import Term
print(Term.make_logo())
```

`Term.jl` uses a simple *markup* syntax to add style information to standard Julia strings.
It also provides `Renderable` objects such as the `Panel`s and `TextBox`es that you can see in the example below.
These too can be styled, and include styled text, but more importantly they can benested and stacked to produce
structured visual displays in your terminal. 



### Installation
In a Julia script:
```Julia
using Pkd

Pkg.add("Term")
```

or in the Julia REPL
```
julia> ]  # enters the pkg interface
pkg> add Term
```

done!

!!! note "A note on `Rich`
    Term.jl is based on a pre-existing package called `rich` (see [here](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)) developed by Will McGugan.
    While most of how `Term.jl` handles things under the hood is specific to `Term`, the basic concepts behind how to even begin creating fancy terminal
    outputs like the ones that `rich` and `Term` can produce are entirely Will's work. 

    We're very thankful to Will for making `rich`'s code open soruce and for the help and encouragement during the development of `Term`.
