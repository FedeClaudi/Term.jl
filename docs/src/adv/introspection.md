# Introspection
Introspection refers to code that looks into another bit of code (or itself) to give you more details about it. 

!!! tip "Check out REPR"
    The easiest way to do introspection with Term is to use the [Term Repr](@ref ReprDoc) functionality including functions such as  `termshow` and `@showme` to get all the details you need about your Julia code. Head over there to find out more. This section highlights methods to inspect types and expressions.

## `typestree`
As you know, one of Julia's defining features is its hierarchical types structure. Sometimes, you want to get an overview of this hierarchy but there isn't always a convenient way achieve that... or is there...

```@example
import Term: typestree

print(typestree(Float64))

```



## Expression & `expressiontree`
If you're doing a bit of metaprogramming (or teaching it to new Julia coders), you want to get an idea of what the parts of the `Expr` you're building are. You can use `expressiontree` to get a [Tree](@ref TreeDoc) based visualization:

```@example
import Term: expressiontree
expr = :(2x + âˆšx^y)
expressiontree(expr)
```

enjoy!
