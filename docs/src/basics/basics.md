# Intro
This section aims to introduce the basic concepts about `Term`. It will show how to create *styled text* with color and style information and how to create more complex renderable objects such as `Panel` and `TextBox`es. Finally we'll go over how to 'stack' these renderables to crate complex layouts in your terminal. 

The main goal of all of this is to produce beautiful, informative, terminal outputs. 
`Term` can do a lot more than this (e.g., it can replace the standard logging system in Julia), but this kind of advanced functionality is discussed in a separate section.

Let's get started!
