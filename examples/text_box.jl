    This example shows how to use TextBox



Sometimes, you have a very long piece of text to print to the console.
But you don't want to just print one long string, you want your text to e.g., have a fixed width. 
Maybe you want it to fit within a larger layout of Term Renderables (see layout example). 
Or maybe you just want to control the text's appeareance.

Whatever the reason, TextBox is here for you.
